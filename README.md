10 Vanilla JavaScript Projects Assignment
---

**Objective**:

Demonstrate your understanding of vanilla JavaScript fundamentals by implementing ten interactive projects. You will use ChatGPT as a coding assistant to help you create each project, focusing on learning through collaboration and iterative problem-solving. These projects will showcase your ability to manipulate the DOM, use event listeners, handle user inputs, and manage program state—all with pure JavaScript.

**Requirements**:

1. **Project Files**:
    - Create **ten individual HTML files** in the root of your repository, named as follows:
        - `project01.html`
        - `project02.html`
        - `project03.html`
        - ... up to `project10.html`.
    - If any project requires external JavaScript, place the `.js` files in a `js` directory within your repository.

2. **Projects**:
    Each project must meet the requirements outlined below:

    1. **Customizable Digital Clock**:
        - Display the current time in a digital clock format that updates every second.
        - Allow users to toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
        - Include options to customize the clock's color scheme and font size.
        - Add alarm functionality where users can set alerts.
        - Save user preferences and alarms using `localStorage`.

    2. **Interactive To-Do List**:
        - Allow users to add, edit, delete, and reorder tasks.
        - Mark tasks as completed and filter by status (all, completed, pending).
        - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks.
        - Persist tasks and statuses using `localStorage`.

    3. **Memory Matching Game**:
        - Create a grid of cards that can be flipped to find matching pairs.
        - Randomize the layout on each new game.
        - Track and display the number of moves and the time taken to complete the game.
        - Include a restart button to reset the game.

    4. **Dynamic Quiz App**:
        - Present a set of predefined multiple-choice questions.
        - Track the user’s score and provide feedback for each question.
        - Display a summary of results at the end, including correct answers.
        - Allow users to review their responses and correct answers.

    5. **Customizable Drawing Canvas**:
        - Provide a drawing canvas where users can draw with their mouse.
        - Allow customization of brush size, brush color, and canvas background color.
        - Implement an undo button to remove the last stroke and a clear button to reset the canvas.
        - Add an option to save the canvas as an image.

    6. **Interactive Periodic Table**:
        - Create a grid layout representing the periodic table.
        - Clicking on an element displays detailed information (e.g., atomic number, symbol, group).
        - Include a search bar to find elements by name, symbol, or atomic number.
        - Highlight the selected element and its group.

    7. **Virtual Calculator**:
        - Build a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations and displays inputs dynamically.
        - Include advanced functions like square roots, percentages, and memory recall.
        - Handle errors like division by zero gracefully.
        - Provide a clear button to reset all inputs.

    8. **Interactive Story Game**:
        - Create a text-based adventure game with a branching narrative.
        - Track and display the user’s progress visually.
        - Include a reset button to restart the game.
        - Allow users to save and resume their progress using `localStorage`.

    9. **Sorting Visualization Tool**:
        - Create a visual tool to demonstrate sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort).
        - Animate the sorting process and allow users to select the algorithm.
        - Provide commentary or explanations for each step of the sorting process.
        - Include controls to adjust animation speed and reset the array.

    10. **Customizable Keyboard Trainer**:
        - Display random text strings for users to type, tracking speed and accuracy.
        - Highlight errors in real time and calculate words per minute (WPM) and accuracy.
        - Allow users to adjust the difficulty (e.g., string length, special characters).
        - Provide a results summary and restart option.

3. **GitHub Repository**:
    - Place all `projectXX.html` files in the root of your GitHub repository.
    - Place any external JavaScript files in a `js` directory within the repository.

**Submission Instructions**:

1. Push all files to your GitHub Classroom repository.
2. Verify that each project file (`project01.html` through `project10.html`) works independently and meets the outlined requirements.

**Assessment**:

1. **Functionality**: Does each project meet all specified requirements and function as intended?
2. **Code Quality**: Is your code clean, organized, and easy to follow?
3. **Creativity**: Have you added any unique touches or enhancements to the projects?
4. **Completion**: Are all ten projects present, functional, and properly structured in the repository?
